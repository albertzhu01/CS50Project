# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Productivity Hub

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that serves as a centralized productivity hub, providing tools that allow users to set goals, create a schedule, list to-do's, and time their work,
while also receiving tips and personalized feedback based on their activity.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

When a user first opens our website, they will encounter a welcome page with graphical information about the productivity hub -- such as its planning and goal-setting features.
They will then be prompted to create an account using a username and password, which will unlock the hub.
The homepage for logged-on users will be a simple layout that welcomes the user and allows them to enter their top focus for the day. In addition, it will provide a link to the summary page.
The summary page, which can be accessed via a collapsible side banner or the homepage, will provide a spread of the different productivity features and their user-inputted data.
For example, it will have a chart that allows users to input their planned study time for the week as well as make daily goals. This page will also have a timing feature (pomodoro and stopwatch),
a to-do list where users can add, delete, and check-off tasks, a notepad where users can write, delete, and save notes, and motivational tips. In the side banner, users will be able to navigate
to the archive (where completed to-do’s and notes are stored), informational page (containing personalized tips and potentially data visualizations), and a settings page (for individualized user settings).

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The website will allow users to create goals, notes, and to-do’s that will be saved in the database so that they can re-view and edit this data each time they log in.
Our website will provide the user with study tips.
The website will provide tools that allow users to organize their goals, notes, and to-do’s in a weekly chart.
In addition to the chart, users can choose to create a list of goals after each day in their charts, and at the end of the day, they can check-off whether or not they have met that goal.
Our website will have a “stopwatch” feature that will allow users to input a time for a given task (between 1 and 30 minutes) and will ring after that duration.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the previous category.
Personalized tips.
Settings that set an avatar for the user.
Minimalist, clean design throughout the website (logo, font, graphics, color-scheme).
Our website will have (in addition to a stopwatch feature) a pomodoro clock that will time users for 25 minutes, with 5 minute breaks.
Provide an archive of completed to-do’s and previous notes taken, organized by date. These archived data can be deleted by the user.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the previous category.
Data visualization.
Ability to export planner to PDF.
Settings for the user that will allow them to change background color/ design and indicate productivity interests (e.g. “time management,” “focus,” “sleep”).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?


Over the course of the next few weeks, we will determine what will be included in our website based on feasibility and feedback from TF’s.
By Thanksgiving break, we will have a solid framework of our website design and will know what tasks we will each need to execute by the end of break.
Our inspiration for the overall design and aesthetics of the website will be a combination of our own ideas and existing organization websites.

New skills that we will need to acquire include:
How to collect and store user data such as usernames and passwords, notes, to-do’s, etc.
How to design a website that provides a layout of all our features to users.
How to create and modify user settings, such as background color or avatar.
How to analyze user data to provide personalized tips/suggestions.
How to make the features interactive -- for example, checking off a to-do or modifying a schedule.
How to “archive” data / move data from one page to another.

Topics that we will need to research include:
More advanced HTML, CSS, and Javascript syntax.
D3 data visualization.
Using python for websites.

In our team of three, we will initially collaborate and help each other on all aspects of the website because there are many skills that we all should learn and research.
However, by Thanksgiving Break, we will plan to have all learned and researched the most vital and fundamental aspects of our project (i.e. what we WILL accomplish no matter what),
so by then, we will assign different pages and functionalities of our website to individual group members.
